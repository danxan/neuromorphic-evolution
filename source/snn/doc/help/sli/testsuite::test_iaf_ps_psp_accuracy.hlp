Name: testsuite::test_iaf_ps_psp_accuracy - test of precise integrate-and-fire neurons' accuracy of PSP

Synopsis:

(test_iaf_ps_psp_accuracy) run -&gt; compare one voltage with analytics


Description:

code updated for NEST 2 but not yet this comment 
test_iaf_ps_psp_accuracy.sli checks the voltage response of the precise versions of the iaf_psc_alpha 
model neurons to a single incoming spike. The voltage excursion is 
called post-synaptic potential (PSP). In the model neurons 
the post-synaptic current is described by an alpha-function 
(see [1] and references therein). The resulting PSP has a finite 
rise-time, with voltage and current beeing zero in the initial 
condition (see [1]). 
The dynamics is tested by connecting a device that emits spikes 
at individually configurable times (see test_spike_generator) to 
a model neuron. 
The weight of the connection specifies the peak value (amplitude) 
of the post-synaptic current (PSC) in pA. 
The subthreshold dynamics of the model neurons is integrated exactly. 
Therefore, it is suitable to check whether the simulation kernel 
produces results independent of the computation step size 
(resolution). 
In order to obtain identical results for different computation 
step sizes h, the SLI script needs to be independent of h. 
This is achieved by specifying all time parameters in milliseconds 
(ms). In particular the time of spike emission and the synaptic 
delay need to be integer multiples of the computation step sizes 
to be tested. test_iaf_dc_aligned_delay demonstrates the strategy 
for the case of DC current input.
