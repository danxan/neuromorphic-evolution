Name: testsuite::test_gif_pop_psc_exp - li script for test of gif_pop_psc_exp

Synopsis:

(test_gif_pop_psc_exp) run -&gt; compare mean and variance of population rate of the model with desired values


Description:

This script simulate an inhibitory population with the population model. After each simulation, it calculates 
the mean and variance of population rate and compare them with desired values. The simulated values should be
