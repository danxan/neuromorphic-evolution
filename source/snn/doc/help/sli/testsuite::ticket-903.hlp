Name: testsuite::ticket-903 - Ensure delays are not strictly rounded up

Synopsis:

(ticket-903) run -&gt; NEST exits if test fails


Description:

This test ensures that delays drawn from continuous distribution are not 
rounded up strictly.


Remarks:

This test is probabilistic, so there is a minuscule chance of it 
failing even if all is well.
