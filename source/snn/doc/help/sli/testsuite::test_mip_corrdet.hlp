Name: testsuite::test_mip_corrdet - li script for testing mip_generator and correlation_detector

Synopsis:

(test_mip_corrdet) run -&gt; compare cout with comments in file


Description:

test_mip_corrdet.sli creates two poisson spiking sources with a rate of 
50 Hz each, which have half of their events in common. The correlation 
detector records these spike trains and calculates the raw cross correlation 
in a time window of +-100 ms with a bin width of 10 ms. 
After the simulation, the accumulated number of events in the bins is displayed.
