Name: testsuite::test_rng_seeds - test if setting and getting of the rng seeds work

Synopsis:

(test_rng_seeds) run -&gt; dies if assertion fails


Description:

This script checks for different numbers of threads if the seeds are 
consistently set for all threads. This script can be run using a 
single process. However, to test all aspects of rng seeding, it should 
be run via mpirun and different numbers of processes.
