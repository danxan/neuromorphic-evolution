Name: testsuite::ticket-452 - Ensure that precise simulations give identical results whether stepped or run continuously

Synopsis:

(ticket-452) run -&gt; NEST exits if test fails


Description:

Ensure that simulations with precise spike timing yield identical results independent of 
whether one simulates the full simulation time without interruption, or splits the simulation 
into many small pieces. 
The problem was unrelated to the setting of kernel property  /off_grid_spiking 
and the spike_detector property  /precise_times.
