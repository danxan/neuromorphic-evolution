Name: testsuite::test_count_connections - Test connection counting for total
number of connections and specific types of connections.

Synopsis:

(test_count_connections) run -&gt; NEST exits if test fails


Description:

This test uses fixed-indegree Connect to connect a net of 100 neurons 
to itself, with 100 connections per neuron, a total of 10000 connections. 
It is checked whether the total number of connections and the number of 
static connections equals 10000. Then additional 10000 connections of type 
stdp_synapse are created. It is checked whether the total number of 
connections is 20000 and the number of stdp connections is 10000.
