Name: testsuite::test_voltmeter_reset - test if resetting works on voltmeter

Synopsis:

(test_voltmeter_reset) run -&gt; dies if assertion fails


Description:

The voltmeter records from iaf_psc_alpha to memory, checks if proper number 
of data points is acquired, deleted on reset, and recorded again on further 
simulation. This test ascertains that also data stored in the derived recorder 
class, not only in RecordingDevice, is reset.
