Name: testsuite::test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator - test basic properties of sinusoidal gamma generator

Synopsis:

(test_sinusoidal_gamma_generator) run -&gt; dies if assertion fails


Description:

This test asserts that 
&bull; that /individual_spike_trains is true by default 
&bull; the /individual_spike_trains property can be set on the model, but not on instances 
&bull; that instances inherit the correct /individual_spike_trains value 
&bull; that different targets (on same or different threads) 
* identical spike trains if /individual_spike_trains is false 
* different spike trains otherwise 
&bull; that a multimeter can be connected to record the rate 
* independent of /individual_spike_trains ..., only a single trace is returned 
&bull; the recorded rate profile is tested against expectation 
This test DOES NOT test the statistical properties of the spike trains generated.
