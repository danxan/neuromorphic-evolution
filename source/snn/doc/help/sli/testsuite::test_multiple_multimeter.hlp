Name: testsuite::test_multiple_multimeter - test support for multiple multimeter

Synopsis:

(test_multiple_multimeter.sli) run -&gt; dies if assertion fails


Description:

This script tests support for multiple multimeters: 
&bull; Connections created must have receptor != 0 
(this test is crucial to find models that have not been modified from 
inline 
port aeif_cond_alpha::connect_sender(DataLoggingRequest&amp; dlr, 
port receptor_type) 
{ 
if (receptor_type != 0) 
throw UnknownReceptorType(receptor_type, get_name()); 
B_.logger_.connect_logging_device(dlr, recordablesMap_); 
return 0; 
}

&bull; Check that one multimeter cannot be connected more than once to 
one neuron 
&bull; Multiple meters with identcial configurations connected to the 
same neuron record identical data
