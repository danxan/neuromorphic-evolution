Name: testsuite::test_multiplicity - Test parallel transmission of spikes with
multiplicity &gt; 1.

Synopsis:

nest_indirect test_multiplicity.sli -&gt; -


Description:

Creates two parrot neurons and connects the first one to the second one. The 
first parrot neuron receives one spike with multiplicity two from a spike 
generator, which should be communicated as two spikes to the second parrot 
neuron. Each parrot neuron is connected to a spike detector, which should 
record two spikes.
