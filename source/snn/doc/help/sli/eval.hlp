Name: eval - evaluate a string of SLI code

Synopsis:

string eval -&gt; obj1 ... objn


Examples:

(1 2 add) eval              --&gt; 3 
([1 2 3] /peter 5 def) eval --&gt; [1 2 3]


Description:

Reads a string and evaluates its content. The resulting objects are 
pushed onto the stack. 
As in regular batch mode the interpreter reads tokens from a 
stream, a string stream in this case, and immediately executes the 
incoming language constructs. 
A similar function to eval also occurs in Python.
