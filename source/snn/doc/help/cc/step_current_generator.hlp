Name: step_current_generator - provides a piecewise constant DC input current

Examples:

The current can be altered in the following way: 
/step_current_generator Create /sc Set 
sc &lt;&lt; /amplitude_times [0.2 0.5] /amplitude_values [2.0 4.0] &gt;&gt; SetStatus 
The amplitude of the DC will be 0.0 pA in the time interval [0, 0.2), 
2.0 pA in the interval [0.2, 0.5) and 4.0 from then on.


Description:

The dc_generator provides a piecewise constant DC input to the 
connected node(s).  The amplitude of the current is changed at the 
specified times. The unit of the current is pA.


Parameters:

The following parameters can be set in the status dictionary: 
\verbatim embed:rst 
==================== ===============  ====================================== 
amplitude_times     list of ms       Times at which current changes 
amplitude_values    list of pA       Amplitudes of step current current 
allow_offgrid_times boolean          Default false 
==================== ===============  ====================================== 
\endverbatim 
If false, times will be rounded to the nearest step if they are 
less than tic/2 from the step, otherwise NEST reports an error. 
If true,  times are rounded to the nearest step if within tic/2 
from the step, otherwise they are rounded up to the *end* of the 
step. 
Note: 
Times of amplitude changes must be strictly increasing after conversion 
to simulation time steps. The option allow_offgrid_times may be 
useful, e.g., if you are using randomized times for current changes 
which typically would not fall onto simulation time steps.
