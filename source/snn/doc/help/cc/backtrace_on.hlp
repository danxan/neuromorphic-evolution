Name: backtrace_on - enable stack backtrace on error.

Synopsis:

backtrace_on -&gt; -


Description:

This functions enables a human readable backtrace of the execution 
stack. This is useful to locate where precisely an error occured. Note 
that this function also disables the interpreter's tail recursion 
optimization and will therefore impose a small performance 
penalty. The command backtrace_off disables the stack backtrace and 
re-enables tail recursion optimization. 
Example:
