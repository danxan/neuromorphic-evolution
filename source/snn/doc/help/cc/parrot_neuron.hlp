Name: parrot_neuron - Neuron that repeats incoming spikes.

Description:

The parrot neuron simply emits one spike for every incoming spike. 
An important application is to provide identical poisson spike 
trains to a group of neurons. The poisson_generator sends a different 
spike train to each of its target neurons. By connecting one 
poisson_generator to a parrot_neuron and then that parrot_neuron to 
a group of neurons, all target neurons will receive the same poisson 
spike train.


Parameters:

No parameters to be set in the status dictionary.


Receives:

SpikeEvent


Sends:

SpikeEvent


Remarks:

&bull; Weights on connection to the parrot_neuron are ignored. 
&bull; Weights on connections from the parrot_neuron are handled as usual. 
&bull; Delays are honored on incoming and outgoing connections. 
&bull; Multiplicity may be used to indicate number of spikes in a single 
time step. Instead of the accumulated weigths of the incoming spikes, the 
number of the spikes is stored within a ring buffer. 
Only spikes arriving on connections to port 0 will be repeated. 
Connections onto port 1 will be accepted, but spikes incoming 
through port 1 will be ignored. This allows setting exact pre- 
and post-synaptic spike times for STDP protocols by connecting 
two parrot neurons spiking at desired times by, e.g., a 
stdp_synapse onto port 1 on the post-synaptic parrot neuron.
