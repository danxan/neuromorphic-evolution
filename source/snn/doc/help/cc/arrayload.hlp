Synopsis:

array Transpose -&gt;  array arrayload -&gt; t1 ... tn n

Description:

The stack is invariant under the sequences 
arrayload arraystore 
arraystore arrayload  . 
arrayload is the SLI version of PostScript operator aload. 
In contrast to PostScript SLI arrays are dynamic therefore 
the syntax of aload and astore is obsolete in SLI. 
If used aload and astore issue a warning message.


Remarks:

There are two obsolete versions existing called aload and astore.
