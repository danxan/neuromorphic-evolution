Name: topology::DumpLayerNodes - write information about layer nodes to file

Synopsis:

ostream layer_gid DumpLayerNodes -&gt; ostream


Examples:

topology using 
/my_layer &lt;&lt; /rows 5 /columns 4 /elements /iaf_psc_alpha &gt;&gt; CreateLayer def 
(my_layer_dump.lyr) (w) file 
my_layer DumpLayerNodes 
close


Description:

Write information about each element in the given layer to the 
output stream. The file format is one line per element with the 
following contents: 
GID x-position y-position [z-position] 
X and y position are given as physical coordinates in the extent, 
not as grid positions. The number of decimals can be controlled by 
calling setprecision on the output stream before calling DumpLayerNodes.


Parameters:

ostream   - open output stream 
layer_gid - topology layer


Remarks:

In distributed simulations, this function should only be called for 
MPI rank 0. If you call it on several MPI ranks, you must use a 
different file name on each.
